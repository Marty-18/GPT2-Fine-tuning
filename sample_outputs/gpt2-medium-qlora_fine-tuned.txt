prompt: 'dancing on the balcony'

answer 1: dancing on the balcony, she saw no man at the door; and her heart was with that gentleman, though he was not yet seated, when she found himself suddenly roused from the sofa by the sudden approach of Sir Thomas Elliot, who came in to apologize for being late. Mrs. Grant was quite unable to say how long he had been gone, but his appearance told her something. He was deep and grave, with the air of an old gentleman; and when the lady shook her head, he blushed deeply with a blush, and his face sunk again, as though he thought she had not been quite able to keep his countenance. At last, however, she gave way, and rising from her chair, asked him if he could shake hands, and said with some warmth, “You did not leave so long ago, did you?--it would appear from your dress!” 



answer 2: dancing on the balcony in a manner which delighted her, and did give her time to admire her new friend, she fancied herself an intimate friend to her father--and that Mrs. Darcy was now quite as attached to her as to herself. 



answer 3: dancing on the balcony of her bedroom, the sight of her brother, William, the little boy whom she had once used to love so much, received by all the rest, was not yet complete to her. The colour rose in agitation. To what purpose had he been to leave such a woman so cold? The confusion was obvious; to what purpose could she bear to have William's affection withdrawn so completely! She could hardly believe that it was not for an effort of her own; and no sooner was the conviction confirmed by such an attack, than she seized a sheet of paper and pushed it forward. 

answer 4: dancing on the balcony, the ladies began to approach, and she eagerly took in the scene. The whole room seemed to be moving; it was as if the whole staircase of the house were moving--and her friend's voice did not betray her agitation; it was not the voice of a person whose mind was more depressed than he. 



asnwer 5: dancing on the balcony, they were not sorry for it, for the ball was a week later than they were inclined to stay. It was one of the earliest amusements and had been talked of with as a mere pleasure; but Anne could not give in, and she was determined that whatever the weather, they were coming to see some thing they loved, especially the weather, which had escaped their observation for an hour. They were to take in the delightful view of a clear evening, rising in a twilight sky, through the grove-trees in which they had been walking. The view was of no small consequence to Anne, who had seen it as she rode up before; and she had seen, with equal pleasure, Mr. Woodhouse, with whom she had sat the day before. The evening was fine in comparison with those of Mr. Woodhouse's ball.
