asnwer 1: dancing on the balcony," she said. "I couldn't help it. It just took me a moment. I could not contain myself."
Kurt and Amy, her friends, who were watching, told The Post they were "very relieved to see the two of them together."
Amy, 35, is married to Tom Schramm, and was wearing an "E.T. costume" that featured her face and hair.
"She had to be dressed up to be with them that night," said Jessica L. Schwartz, her mother.
Schwartz, 31, was sitting in a nearby dining room when she heard a loud boom when the apartment door opened. She rushed over to find Amy naked and on the floor, covered in blood.
Amy told her mother: "He hit me."
Schwartz said her daughter had been wearing a dress, and that had been ripped off. The clothes were torn, she said.
Amy's father, Robert J. Schramm, was at the restaurant around that time, and said he had just taken his daughter out of school because she was sick.
The couple lived in an apartment near the home of a neighbor, who had called the police.

answer 3: dancing on the balcony, but when I finally get to it and hear my father say it, I know it's time to head out.  I still get goosebumps from that moment.
The second night I am actually having nightmares about it; it's probably something like, "I'm going to burn down the house" but I can't explain it without saying more.
