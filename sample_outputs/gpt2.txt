"We had gotten our groceries together and it was just like, 'Well, it's time to go outside!' And that's kind of how I saw it when I got up to leave," she said.

The two women also said they never had a "sex scandal" like it did for several women in Chicago in the '60s.

"I mean, they'd be so proud, but like, 'I know what you want for Halloween. I know you need to do something for Halloween,' so you just want to do it."

Devin said that he is "absolutely floored" to hear that some of his neighbors are openly gay. But he also thinks he "still thinks that maybe it's time that the Chicago police do something about it."

"What do you call a city that is like Chicago, like you have a police chief that's like 'Oh, you gotta come out' but you're in this community and all of a sudden you have such a crazy idea about everything you do and what you're doing?" he said. "How can that really happen?"


example 2: dancing on the balcony and the scene was interrupted by the sound of the shots being made.

Mr DeSoto, 27, a student at Chiscot House in Hackney, was in the audience when the shooting occurred.

He was in his home and noticed what he thought was a white van travelling towards him at one end of the venue, heading right up towards him.

The vehicle stopped but the victim was not able to get over to him, with Ms DeSoto shouting, "No more shooting at him."

A passer-by who was standing on the street behind the attacker also heard a shot and said they couldn't believe what was happening

He said he had never seen the police officer so clearly, and that he had no idea where it was coming from.

"We thought the van was coming straight at us from the end of the building, but in fact, I just saw a white van," Mr DeSoto said.

As he and other pedestrians took cover on the ground, one shot was fired, and Mr DeSoto said that while it was the first time he'd seen something like this before, in his home city he had been told it had been coming at him from a long way off.

The victim was later arrested in connection with the shooting.

Mr DeSoto, who is a teacher, said he believes it was only a matter of time before anyone found him.
